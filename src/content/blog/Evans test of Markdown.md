# *The* Test of Markdown
## Why Markdown?

I’ve been learning how to write HTML. Whoop-de-doo. It’s fun, but I’ve come across one issue - The page is only useful long term if someone is willing to maintain it. Ever seen a page on the interwebs that looks like it’s from 2002 and nobody bothered to maintain it? 

It’s similar to a concept in tech - If you create a tool or script(or even implement a tool), and you don’t make it super simple for somebody else to come in and use it - It’s pretty much worth nothing to them. Why would they use it? They might as well start from scratch.

I’ve built some HTML pages in my quest to learn how to be a web developer, but I find as soon as I create them, I’d kind of rather not touch them again. It’s like jumping back into a 2,000 piece puzzle after not having touched it for a couple weeks(even though it’s been on that folding table in your living room, in your way the whole time being ignored). 

## Wordpress

One of the systems designed to tackle this problem is Wordpress. How does it do it? It maintains a central piggy bank of usually text files and images are then taken and formatted to look nice and made into a webpage. 

Think “Content Management Systems”. Kind of but not really. You’ve decoupled the content from the creation of the web page.

This is similar to programming, where you try to separate each cog of a machine into separate buckets, and then figure out exactly how and where those cogs need to touch, and then put those cogs together in a way where you can still remove a cog at anytime and modify only that cog without affecting the rest of the machine. 

So I’ve probably described Wordpress wrong, as it’s been around so long and I’m sure has changed, but let’s take a look at a similar system

## Static Website Generators

One of the great ways you can manage a blog is by using markdown to manage the text and content. Markdown is a ~~language~~ ~~format~~ syntax that allows you to format the text with the text alone. For example, putting two asterisks before **and** after a word in markdown formatting makes it bold. You can use a hashtag to make a line a header. And so on.

A static site generator takes a markdown formatted text file, and runs that through a magic generator machine to create a webpage with the content of the formatted text file. Voila!

## Spreading your note taking wings 

One of the advantages of this is the lack of “vendor lock in”. Have you ever wanted a new way to take notes on your phone, but all of your current notes are in X or Y note taking application? With Apple notes, it’s not a straightforward task to export all your notes(I’ve never done it nor know how)… That’s lock in, one of Apples great strengths that I fully ~~embrace~~ um ~~am stuck with~~ use! 

There is the alternative of markdown based note taking apps, where you can export all your notes with a click of a button, and import them into another markdown app with a click of a button. It’s liberating if you ever try it! It’s like having full control over all the info you’ve dumped out of your head. Take **that**, Microsoft OneNote!!

Using Markdown is just one form to avoid losing control of your data - There are many more ways, but this way is sure a darn good one!

## What now?

So I will be working on documenting more of my ideas and projects to share them! I really like formulating and solidifying what I’m learning by doing that.

And with any luck, using markdown to remove friction at different parts of blog creation, maintenance, and control - I should be able to do it quicker and more often!
